                <h2>Shenandoah National Park</h2>
                <p>As one of Virginia's most well-known and beautiful parks, it is a sight to behold. The park is also one of Virginia's biggest, consisting of nearly 200,000 acres of protected and beautiful trails, waterfalls, and wildlife. Of course, one of the park's most iconic features is Skyline Drive. The road travels nearly 100 miles up, down, and sometimes through the Blue Ridge Mountains. It was a highlight for me when I went, at least.</p>

                <h2>First Landing State Park</h2>
                <p>As often seen in their advertising, First Landing State Park is the most visited park in all of Virginia. And is hard not to see why! It is not nearly as big as Shenandoah, sitting on nearly 3,00 acres of protected land with 1.5 miles of beach coastline. As you can tell from the name, its most iconic aspect is the park's historical roots. It also holds the honor of being the location of where the first English settlers landed to establish Jamestown from England.</p>

                <h2>Assateague Island National Seashore</h2>
                <p>The third and final park on this list is Assateague Island National Seashore, a collaborative effort between the National Park Service and the National Fish & Wildlife Service. Comprised of 48,000 acres of protected shores and inland rivers, it is quite quaint when compared to other parks. It's most captivating lure however, is its wild horse population that you can see swimming near the coastline on boat tours.</p>
