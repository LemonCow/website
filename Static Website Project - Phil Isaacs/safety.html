                <h2>Safety Tip #1: Always have water</h2>
                <p>One of the worst things that you can do when it comes to hiking is not bringing enough water with you. Especially on longer trails, the dangers of deyhydration and heat can be deadly if you are not careful. My rule of thumb is to bring at least two more water bottles than you think you need.  And if you ever bring pets with you, I recommend getting a portable bowl to make it quick and easy. </p>

                <h2>Safety Tip #2: Do your research</h2>
                <p>It is always a good idea to look more into the area you choose to hike into. Knowing about what dangerous animals are common in an area, the common weather patterns of a particular trail, or just knowing how many people tend to go to that particular trail can be life-saving information. It also just saves you from getting sunburnt cause you didn't bother to look at the weather forecast that day. </p>

                <h2>Safety Tip #3: Avoid the beaten path</h2>
                <p>When out hiking, do your best to stay on the trail as often as you can. There is often a good reason why the area you want to explore has no path leading to it. And going off the path increases the chances of you getting lost in an unfamiliar area that is potentially dangerous. So please, just use your common sense and don't travel to far off the beaten path.</p>

                <h2>Safety Tip #4: Check for Ticks</h2>
                <p>Ticks can often be hard to notice if you aren't looking for them, and depending on the time of year can be quite numerous. So be sure to check your body for ticks after hikes or outings to the park. Take precautionary measures by using bug spray and tucking your pants into your shoes to lower exposure. </p>
