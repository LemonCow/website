                <h2>Crabtree Falls Trail</h2>
                <p>This moderately difficult trail is very rewarding, with many beautiful sightlines and waterfalls. It is a fairly popular trail, so don't go expecting to much solitute on the hike. It took my family and me roughly 2 hours to complete, so I would recommend to bring some snacks and plenty of water. Another bonus is that it is dog friendly! If you had to go on any of the trails mentioned here, do this one. </p>

                <h2>White Oak Canyon and Cedar Run Trail</h2>
                <p>This is the most difficult trail on the list, being a 5-hour hike of difficult terrain. Despite the difficulty, it had some of the best views I have ever seen in Virginia. The waterfalls were especially amazing. I only give this trial 3.5 stars instead of 5 because My family and I were not expecting a difficult trial and it soured the rest of the day. Just be prepared and well-equipped for this trail, and you'll have a good time.</p>

                <h2>Forest Hill Park Trail</h2>
                <p>Another moderately difficult route, just near Richmond offers a much different hiking experience than the previous two. Being near Richmond, this park has a lot of old and cool-looking structures dotted throughout. As I love Virginia's history, it adds to the appeal. Forest Hill is the most quaint and quiet hike on the list, but sometimes that is just what you are looking for. </p>
